                    <p>Painted Pop’s is a Limited liability company that had started back up in 2013 when we had the first thought of painting Funko Pops. In 2019 we had gotten permission to team up with Amazon Prime to get you your package as fast as possible (longest wait is 2 days) for as cheap as possible (FREE). The owner (Blake Yaratch) had been in the business industry since 2003. He has gone through major art schools such as Harvard, Yale and even University of California. Of course he did not graduate any of these but he did get a B in art class in high school.
